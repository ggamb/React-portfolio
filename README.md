## Description
I built this React portfolio entirely from scratch to show off some of my web development work to date. In this portfolio, you will find some information about me, a contact page, links to my work, and my resume. If you have any comments or questions about this portfolio, please feel free to reach out!

Either use [this](https://ggamb.github.io/React-portfolio/) link or clone the code to your machine, navigate to the root directory in your favorite IDE, run `npm i` to install dependencies, and then run `npm start` to automatically bring up my portfolio in your browser.
